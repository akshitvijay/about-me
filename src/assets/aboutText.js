   "about":"I Currently work as a SDET at Mindtickle Inc Pune. I finished my Bachelors in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from University Of Pune. Apart from work I like to learn different web technologies and find interesting problems to solve using whatever I learnt. This Page is an attempt to document all such endeavours. When I am not doing any of the above, I like to write my own songs and sing them at open mics."
